✓ Infinite loop is caused by a client receiving an event after sending one himself
Fixed by adding a variable named ignore_next_event

✓ When changing the time of the video while the video is paused time doesn't sync

x Arrow keys cause desynchronization (holding the keys causes this)

x (needs testing) when clicking on a video in more videos other players will not switch video

x When new user joins time is reset for current users

x When new user joins the room, video is not same video if already in-room users changed the video

✓ If you press pause on one user and then play on different user the first user doesn't receive an event
Fixed by changing synchronization method to a general server state

x Sending an incorrect youtube link causes the player to display an error

x (needs testing) Sending a non-youtube link

x Inputting an incorrect link creates a wrong entry in the video history
